- `link_front_turn_table` and `link_rear_turn_table`:
  - The base turns the turntable.
  - The turntable rotates the body with two limbs in a perpendicular plane.

- `link_front_body` and `link_rear_body`:
  - No main motors on this body.
  - Randevous mechanisms (to dock and to join bodies with other robots).
  - Stereo-cameras and small motors to turn them around.
  - A port to attach a limb on either side.
